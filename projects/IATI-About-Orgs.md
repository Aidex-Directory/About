# Volunteer Project: Building About Agents for IATI Organizations

## Project Overview

This volunteer-driven initiative will maintain a **comprehensive, current list of organizations that publish their organizational XML data through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)**. The primary mission is to empower the global aid transparency community by deploying an “About Agent” for each reporting organization, making their mission, vision, and identity easily accessible and agent-ready.

With nearly **1,000 organizations publishing to IATI**, this project offers a real-world, high-impact opportunity for contributors to drive open data innovation, learn about agentic systems, and participate in a global transparency movement.

## Volunteer Tasks

### 1. **Organization List Maintenance**
- Proactively gather, clean, and update the master list of organizations publishing IATI Org XML files.
- Ensure metadata accuracy including organization names, identifiers, XML file URLs, and contact points.

### 2. **About Agent Codebase Development**
- Collaborate to create a robust, reusable, and open source codebase for About Agents.
- Ensure the codebase is:
  - Modular and easy to configure for different organizations
  - Well-documented to support rapid volunteer onboarding
  - Extensible to support new features or data sources

### 3. **Generating about-org.html Files**
- For each organization, generate an `about-org.html` file utilizing mission, vision, and summary info drawn from IATI XML and other public sources.
- Standardize file structure for consistency across all About Agents.
- Accommodate customizations based on organizational uniqueness.

### 4. **Testing and Iteration**
- Use `about-org.html` files to thoroughly test About Agents, validating that core info is correctly ingested, parsed, and presented.
- Create and maintain different test versions of the HTML files (e.g., with/without images, with extra sections, edge cases) to facilitate advanced agent testing, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning.
- Contribute bug fixes, enhancements, and new test cases openly.

## Volunteer Experience & Impact

- **Real-World Experience:**  
  Work on live open data and agentic systems at scale, and see your contributions immediately benefit public transparency.
- **Skill Building:**  
  Grow your expertise in Python, web data processing, agent design, structured data standards (IATI), and collaborative open source engineering.
- **Community & Mission:**  
  Collaborate with a global group of peers, organization staff, and open data advocates.

## Long-Term Goals

- Maintain the world’s most accurate, agent-ready catalog of IATI-participating organizations.
- Build a sustainable, open About Agent framework that supports any non-profit in becoming "agentic ready".
- Foster a diverse community of volunteers building the future of open, transparent, AI-augmented humanitarian work.
