# üß© Orchestration Agent

The **Orchestration Agent** acts as the central coordinator for all organization-specific agents. Its main role is to receive incoming queries or tasks and intelligently route each request to the appropriate specialized agent‚Äîsuch as the About Agent, Contact Agent, or Application Agent.

- **How it works:**  
  The Orchestration Agent analyzes each request (e.g., informational, contact, application) and forwards it to the matching agent for handling. If a request matches multiple domains, the orchestrator can aggregate responses from several agents before replying.

- **Why use it:**  
  - Provides a unified entry point for all external and internal requests.
  - Keeps the system modular‚Äîadding, updating, or removing specialized agents is easy.
  - Improves security and transparency by managing which agents handle which queries.
  - Scales with your organization‚Äôs needs as new agents and capabilities are added.

- **Example:**  
  A user query like ‚ÄúWhat is your mission and who is your director?‚Äù is received by the Orchestration Agent, which delegates the mission part to the About Agent and the leadership part to the Contact Agent, then combines their replies into a single response.

The Orchestration Agent helps organizations manage their growing ecosystem of AI agents simply, safely, and efficiently.
