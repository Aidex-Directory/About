# Micro-Payments Agent

The **Micro-Payments Agent** is an open source agent designed to empower organizations to experiment with digital payments, enabling their agents to seamlessly handle micro-transactions for services or data provided and to make payments to other organizations’ agents. This agent helps organizations explore new business models, incentivize contributions, and support sustainable agent ecosystems.

## 💸 What is the Micro-Payments Agent?

The Micro-Payments Agent acts as an intelligent payment facilitator, enabling agents to:

- **Charge for access** to certain services, API endpoints, or datasets exposed by the organization’s agents (e.g., data premium, specialized analytics, task automation).
- **Send payments** to other organizations’ agents for usage of external services, data access, premium features, or automation fees.

Transactions are typically small, fast, and automated (“micro-payments”), supporting granular usage-based pricing and low-cost experimentation.

## 🤖 What Does the Micro-Payments Agent Do?

- Integrates with digital payment platforms or micro-payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Lightning Network, custom tokens)
- Authenticates and authorizes payments for requested services before releasing responses/data
- Issues payment requests (invoices) to users or other agents as-needed
- Tracks payment status, balances, and transaction logs
- Facilitates both **incoming** (charges) and **outgoing** (remittances) agent payments
- Can be configured to support sandbox or “test mode” for safe experimentation

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- **Premium API Access:**  
  Organization’s analytics agent charges a nominal micro-fee for access to advanced data or high-frequency queries.

- **Cross-Agent Payments:**  
  Your agent invokes a specialized service offered by another organization’s agent and automatically settles the payment upon completion.

- **Automated Donations/Incentives:**  
  Agents route a percentage of proceeds to partners, contributors, or beneficiaries based on predefined rules.

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

| Endpoint              | Method | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `/invoice`            | POST   | Generate an invoice for requested service                 |
| `/pay`                | POST   | Complete payment for a specified invoice                  |
| `/transaction/{id}`   | GET    | Check status/details of a specific transaction            |
| `/balance`            | GET    | Query current balance and recent transaction summary      |

_All responses are JSON._

## 👩‍💻 How it Works

- Receives service requests (directly or via other agents)
- Checks if the requested service requires payment
- Issues an invoice and waits for payment confirmation
- On success, authorizes access/provides the requested data or service
- For outgoing payments, the agent authenticates, initiates, and confirms transactions to other organizations’ payment-enabled agents

## 🌍 Networked/Composable Usage

- Integrate with the Orchestration Agent for centralized payment handling across your entire agent ecosystem
- Chain other agents (e.g., analytics, data, consultancy) to the Micro-Payments Agent to selectively monetize premium capabilities
