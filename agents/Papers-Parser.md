# Papers-Parser Agent

The **Papers Parser Agent** is an open source AI agent designed to parse and understand an organization’s documents, especially PDF files, and answer both standardized and customizable questions about their content. This agent empowers organizations to unlock valuable insights from reports, research, and internal documentation, all while maintaining control, transparency, and opportunities for continuous improvement.

## 📄 What is the Papers Agent?

The Papers Agent is a specialized agent that:

- Parses and extracts structured and unstructured data from PDF documents
- Answers predefined standard questions (e.g., "What is the main conclusion?", "Who authored this paper?", "What methodology was used?")
- Handles customizable, user-defined queries for deeper research or operational insight
- Enables organizations to build, fine-tune, and monitor parsers tailored to their document types and subject matter
- Tracks queries and responses, supporting quality monitoring, transparency, and agent/model improvement

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- **Research Summaries:**  
  Instantly answer questions about organizational reports, technical papers, evaluations, or whitepapers.

- **Operational Transparency:**  
  Extract and share key project findings, budgets, or methodologies with stakeholders.

- **Knowledge Management:**  
  Query archived documents for specific facts, recommendations, or outcomes.

- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  Review and improve parser performance based on monitored queries and feedback.

### 3. Add Your Documents

Place your PDF files in the `data/` directory.
