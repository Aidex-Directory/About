# IATI Activities Agent

The **IATI Activities Agent** is an open source AI agent that enables organizations to expose and share comprehensive data from their IATI (International Aid Transparency Initiative) Activity XML files. This agent provides structured, standards-compliant access to the details of an organization‚Äôs aid activities‚Äîimproving transparency, discoverability, and data interoperability across the humanitarian and development sectors.

## üåç What is IATI Activity Data?

**IATI Activity XML** files are the heart of IATI reporting, containing rich, structured information about an organization‚Äôs individual aid and development projects‚Äîincluding objectives, sectors, budgets, participating organizations, results, locations, and timelines. Publishing this data supports global transparency, project coordination, and evidence-based decision-making.

## ü§ñ What Does the IATI Activities Agent Do?

- Parses an organization‚Äôs official IATI Activity XML files
- Responds to detailed queries about projects, timelines, objectives, locations, finances, results, and more
- Delivers structured, machine-readable outputs via API or local queries
- Integrates seamlessly with other agents (such as an Orchestration Agent or IATI Org Agent)

## üí° Example Use Cases

- Powering public dashboards displaying active aid or development projects
- Supporting data aggregation and analysis for consortia or donors
- Enabling automated, up-to-date project listings on organizational websites
- Providing detailed answers about where and how aid is being delivered
