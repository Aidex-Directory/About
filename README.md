# Aid Exchange Directory

The **aidex.directory** is an experimental **NANDA Index** sub-directory specifically developed for the humanitarian community. It provides aid organizations with a **registry** for their AI agents, facilitating discovery, authentication and integration into the NANDA ecosystem and the broader internet of AI agents. The **Aidex** initiative provides aid organizations with a **gateway** to interface with Project NANDA and join pioneering agentic AI research, development and testing benefitting the humanitarian sector.

## Project NANDA

> "Project [NANDA](https://nanda.media.mit.edu/) (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) is an ambitious MIT initiative developing the foundational infrastructure for a true "Internet of AI Agents." Just as the early web required DNS and HTTP protocols to scale, NANDA is creating the essential building blocks to support trillions of autonomous AI agents that can discover, verify, and collaborate in real-time across decentralized networks. The project envisions specialized AI agents collaborating across a decentralized architecture, where each agent performs discrete functions while communicating seamlessly, navigating autonomously, socializing, learning, earning and transacting on our behalf."

#### The NANDA Index

Project NANDA is developing the foundational infrastructure behind the agentic web linking agents through interoperable public and private facts registries operated by different organizations and initiatives but adhering to shared standards to ensure portability and trust. The **NANDA Index** is an open registry for autonomous AI agents that is operated by Project NANDA. It is a registrar on the agentic web that stores machine-readable JSON “facts files" that describe agents' identities, capabilities, endpoints, and policies. The index enables reliable discovery, authentication, interaction, and lifecycle management across heterogeneous systems.

#### List39

[List39](https://list39.org/) is a Project NANDA aligned vendor-neutral registry enabling AI agent discovery, capability declaration, and trust establishment in distributed agentic systems. List39 and the NANDA Index showcase how registries function, work in sync, and help establish information sharing norms and best practices.

### Aidex.directory

**Aidex** is an open source community initiative providing humanitarian aid organizations with a gateway to get involved in Project NANDA and contribute to the overall development of an agentic internet that is safe, effective, and ethically aligned with the missions and values of member organizations. The initiative's [aidex.directory](https://aidex.directory) establishes a dedicated agent facts registry for aid organizations and their partners (e.g., government agencies, donors, and others). The Aidex registry, the NANDA Index and List39 are interoperable. Their JSON facts files are similar and the registries facilitate the integration of agents into the NANDA ecosystem and the broader internet of AI agents in the same ways.

Aidex however adds extra **standard** fields to its registry specially developed by the humanitarian community to reflect sector-specific priorities and research objectives. Organizations can also add **experimental** fields to their agent facts files. This makes it possible to link agents to operational initiatives or focus areas, incorporate reporting fields from humanitarian open data frameworks (e.g., the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](https://iatistandard.org/en/) (IATI)), and integrate elements from related projects (e.g., Carnegie Mellon’s [Project LOKA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10915)) into agent documentation. This extensibility enables organizations to use the registry as a sandbox to test and evaluate new fields, improve the registry, and conduct specialized research.

#### File Repository

![File Repo](https://github.com/Aidex-Directory/About/blob/main/media/File-Repo.png)

The Aidex registry is principally designed to store agent facts files. However, to support collaboration and early stage testing, organizations can also use the registry as a **data repository** and **file storage bucket**. This added capability enables organizations to run reliable, shared tests of core agent functions like agent-to-agent interaction, document parsing, knowledge exchange and micro-payment transactions.

### Research

Aidex supports agentic AI research with a specific emphasis on helping aid organizations develop their first agents, then plug these into agentic systems and test basic interaction and knowledge sharing. Organizations can then leverage the initiative to carry out more advanced research examining critical facets of agentic systems, like the internal logic of an agent (reflection and reasoning, identity, and wallets); the external dynamics of collaboration, human interaction, and coordination protocols; and the overarching ethical considerations that guide development for example.

#### Priority Research

![Searc Agents](https://github.com/Aidex-Directory/About/blob/main/media/Priority-Research.png)

As AI-powered search evolves and agentic systems increasingly mediate information retrieval and knowledge exchange, both through search engine integration and direct agent-to-agent interaction, aid organizations must adapt to new roles. Beyond acting as information seekers, users, and publishers, they will also need to optimize AI search outputs and manage agentic systems. With this in mind, Aidex’s priority research focuses on:

* **Citation dynamics**: Analyzing how aid-related web content, PDFs, and XML data are cited by AI search engines, and testing how controlled content modifications affect visibility and integration into AI-generated answers.
* **Agent integration**: Investigating how embedding agents into search processes influences accuracy, reliability, and diversity of information delivered to end users.
* **Benchmarking systems**: Comparing AI search engine outputs with those of agentic knowledge-sharing systems by systematically varying content inputs, establishing search as a baseline, and measuring whether agentic approaches can meet or surpass it.

#### Get Involved

**Aidex** is an open source community initiative run by volunteers. It is overseen, supported, and managed by member organizations and their partners. To get involved or to learn more about the initiative, **contact**: brent(at)aidex.ngo
