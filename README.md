![NANDA Sub-directory](https://github.com/Aidex-Directory/About/blob/main/media/AidExchange1000.png)

The **aidex.directory** is an experimental **NANDA Index** sub-directory specifically developed for the humanitarian community. It provides aid organizations and their partners with a **registry** for their AI agents, facilitating discovery, authentication and integration into the NANDA ecosystem, and a **gateway** to collectively interface with Project NANDA and participate in foundation-laying agentic AI research, development and testing activities benefitting the humanitarian sector.

## Project NANDA

> "Project [NANDA](https://nanda.media.mit.edu/) (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) is an ambitious MIT initiative developing the foundational infrastructure for a true "Internet of AI Agents." Just as the early web required DNS and HTTP protocols to scale, NANDA is creating the essential building blocks to support trillions of autonomous AI agents that can discover, verify, and collaborate in real-time across decentralized networks. The project envisions specialized AI agents collaborating across a decentralized architecture, where each agent performs discrete functions while communicating seamlessly, navigating autonomously, socializing, learning, earning and transacting on our behalf."

NANDA's technical architecture establishes a comprehensive infrastructure for distributed agent intelligence, leveraging and extending existing frameworks like Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. At its core, the system features a decentralized registry that functions as a DNS for agents, facilitating their discovery, authentication, and verifiable interactions across the entire network. This is complemented by advanced agent-to-agent communication protocols that not only provide the foundational language for AI interaction but also include sophisticated mechanisms for agents to locate one another within the network. Furthermore, these protocols enable the querying of distributed knowledge spread across different agent networks, creating a seamless web of interconnected intelligence.

To ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of the agent network, NANDA incorporates robust security and verification protocols. These measures are designed to create a secure environment for all agent interactions by implementing verifiable agent-to-agent exchange accountability. This includes native systems for identity, traceability, and the recording of behavioral patterns, which together ensure that all interactions are transparent and reliable. Supporting this secure framework is a comprehensive developer ecosystem, which provides the necessary tools and services for building upon the NANDA platform. This ecosystem includes a registry of agents, access to various resources and tools, a database of agentic interactions for analysis and learning, and third-party integrations facilitated by both client and server software development kits (SDKs).

## NANDA Index

The **NANDA Index** is an open registry for autonomous AI agents. It stores agent metadata and machine-readable JSON “facts” files that describe an agent's identity, capabilities, endpoints, and policies. The Index enables reliable discovery, authentication, interaction, and lifecycle management across heterogeneous systems.

Project NANDA envisions a decentralized agentic web in which agents are linked through interoperable public and private facts registries operated by different organizations and initiatives but adhering to shared standards to ensure portability and trust. [List39](https://list39.org/) is a Project NANDA aligned vendor-neutral registry enabling AI agent discovery, capability declaration, and trust establishment in distributed agentic systems. List39 and the NANDA Index showcase how registries should function and work together to establish information sharing norms and best practices.

## Aid Exchange Directory

![Aidex Logo](https://github.com/Aidex-Directory/About/blob/main/media/Aidex_Right_Small_cropped.png)

The [aidex.directory](https://aidex.directory) was created to serve the global humanitarian aid community. It establishes a dedicated agent facts registry for AI agents developed by aid organizations and their partners. Like the NANDA Index, the directory facilitates discovery, authentication and the integration of agents into the NANDA ecosystem and the broader internet of AI agents. The **Aid Exchange** (Aidex) initiative and the **aidex.directory** provide organizations with a gateway to interface with Project NANDA and contribute to the overall development of an agentic internet that is safe, effective, and ethically aligned with the missions and values of member organizations.

### Aidex.directory and File Repository

Structurally, the Aidex registry mirrors the NANDA Index and List39. But it adds extra **standard fields** developed by aid organizations and the broader humanitarian community incorporating sector specific priorities and research objectives. Organizations can also add **experimental fields** to their Agent Facts Files. They can use these to link their agents to operational initiatives or focus areas, incorporate lessons from humanitarian open data sharing efforts, and integrate concepts and standards from other projects like Carnegie Mellon's [Project LOKA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10915) or from the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](https://iatistandard.org/en/) (IATI) into their agents and documentation.

To support collaboration and early stage testing, organizations can use the registry as a **data repository** and **file storage bucket**, enabling organizations to run reliable, shared tests of core agent functions like agent-to-agent interaction and knowledge exchange.

## Research Projects

The Aidex initiative is designed to support agentic research, development and testing and to establish a framework through which organizations can collaborate on setting up and registering their first AI agents. Then organizations can experiment with basic interactions and knowledge sharing. Follow-up research will examine critical facets of agentic systems, focusing on three key areas: the internal logic of an agent (reflection and reasoning, identity, and wallets); the external dynamics of collaboration, human interaction, and coordination protocols; and the overarching ethical considerations that guide development.

### AI Search Engines vs AI Agents

As AI-powered search evolves and AI agents play greater roles in improving and facilitating search and knowledge sharing, aid organizations and their partners will need to increasingly understand how to adapt their communications and reporting strategies and approaches as well as learn how to adapt their AI agents.
